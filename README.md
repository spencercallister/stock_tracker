# Overview

I created this project to learn the Java language and demonstrate my knowledge of it. My career as a data engineer has led me to work with a wide range of languages and frameworks, but I wanted to focus on learning Java because many organizations use it to build their ETL pipelines. Tools such as Spark are written in Java, so learning Java was a natural choice.

To learn Java, I decided to write a program that allows the user to add stock's to their personal portfolio and display information pertaining to those stocks such as the quote, profile, and news using the Finnhub API. To store the user's information, I used the free tier of a data warehouse called DuckDB.

By building a comprehensive application that serves information to and from a database and API, I was able to develop a solid understanding of Java and how to work some of its unique tools.
